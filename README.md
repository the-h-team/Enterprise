# Enterprise
###### A fresh, new Minecraft economy system.

---

## What is Enterprise?
### Enterprise is a framework for Minecraft economies.
Enterprise makes it fast and easy to work with detailed Minecraft in-game economies.
If you're here from Bukkit, you'll likely already know of
[Vault's](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/vault.34315/)
[economy service system](https://github.com/MilkBowl/VaultAPI/tree/master/src/main/java/net/milkbowl/vault/economy);
you install Vault and an economy plugin, and you're good to go. We want to keep that
same simplicity in Enterprise. Once you install Enterprise, you can install multiple
economy plugins and manage each of them directly through the plugin.
### Features:
- Multiple provider support
- Transactions
- Account management
- Platform-independent API
