/**
 * <h1>Entities</h1>
 * Entities in Enterprise represent economy participants.
 * <p>
 * Traditional economy interfaces have used separate methods to expose
 * the capabilities of each participant type--if they even have multiple
 * participant types! This leads to duplication--duplicate methods for
 * each type of participant and duplication of effort when wrappers are
 * constructed to expose common functionalities.
 * <p>
 * <h3>Enterprise remedies this by fully separating participant identity
 * and participant capabilities.</h3>
 * This package focuses entirely on participant identity.
